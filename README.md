#Bellroy Robot Challenge

Thank you for taking the time to check out what I was able to put together for this challenge! This was a fun way for me to solidify my skills as well as pick up a few more. I tried to make this basic game more engaging by adding an objective.

If I had more time to work on this project I would make the win condition more complicated. This first step to improve the game would be to set a minimum number of moves and in order to win you would have to get to the battery within that set number. The second step would be to hide the battery and include some sort of hint component (like Minesweeper) so the user would have to strategize which move to make in order to get to the battery in the set number of moves. This was not implemented because I was unable to quickly come up with a dynamic programming solution in order to find the minimum number of moves (I prefer dynamic programming to keep code cleaner and easier to maintain). My solution would be to create a matrix from this array (an array with nested arrays) which would make finding the route a lot easier because I can take the difference between the length of each array to get the horizontal moves [j], and the difference between which array they pieces are located [i]. Although this would increase time complexity to O(n^2), I am unable to figure out a simple mathematical solution to get this condition with a single array.

As you know, the possibilities are endless when building a game like this. I hope you enjoyed this basic game and again I appreciate your consideration for this position!
